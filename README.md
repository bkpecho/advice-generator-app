## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- BEM
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Advice Slip API
- Async/Await
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project, I honed my skills in utilizing asynchronous JavaScript and the fetch API to retrieve data from an external source, and dynamically render it on a webpage. I also reinforced my knowledge of writing maintainable and scalable CSS through the use of Sass and BEM methodologies.

### Continued development

Given the opportunity to further develop this project, I would aim to enhance its interactivity and engagement by incorporating a social media sharing feature to enable users to share the generated advice. Additionally, I would explore more advanced design techniques to create a more immersive and engaging experience for users.
