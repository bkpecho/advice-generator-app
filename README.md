- BEM
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Advice Slip API
- Async/Await
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project, I honed my skills in utilizing asynchronous JavaScript and the fetch API to retrieve data from an external source, and dynamically render it on a webpage. I also reinforced my knowledge of writing maintainable and scalable CSS through the use of Sass and BEM methodologies.

### Continued development

To further elevate the functionality and design of this project, I plan to implement a social media sharing feature that allows users to easily share the generated advice. Additionally, I aim to continue to explore advanced design techniques to create a more captivating and immersive user experience.
